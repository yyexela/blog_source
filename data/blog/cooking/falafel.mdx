# Falafel

Over the weekend I made hummus and falafels! I followed the hummus recipe from [here](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/15938/easy-and-smooth-hummus-recipe/) and the falafel recipe from [here](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/how-to-make-falafel/#tasty-recipes-10436-jump-target). It was super delicious. This is my third time making each and I think I've gotten a hang of the consistency needed for both! I add flour to my falafel mix to help it hold its shape before frying in olive oil. For hummus, I add lots of extra garlic since I like it that way.
