So, I had some left over chocolate chips and wanted to make some cookies! You might be thinking: "Aren't they easy"? The answer is: probably yes. However, the recipe I followed requires *three days* of waiting! Please read the recipe linked below. It contains lots of science around baking and what makes this cookies recipe so good (and why you need to have the patience to wait several days for the cookie dough to taste good).

I followed [Kenjo Lopez-Alt's](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-best-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe) recipe.

Once again: "how did it go!! What did you learn!"

Honestly, the only mistake I made was that I burnt the butter when browning it. I ended up having the little brown particles form, but cooked it too long after. I used a fine mesh sieve to fish out the blackened particles. Other than that, everything was pretty straight-forward!

The cookies tasted delicious and I ate 15 of them in one sitting. LOL.
