# Parmesan Focaccia

Last time I made focaccia it turned out to basically be a breadstick in the shape of a sheet pan. Having gained some confidence from my proofing box, I decided to try my hand at focaccia again! I used [this recipe](https://alexandracooks.com/2018/03/02/overnight-refrigerator-focaccia-best-focaccia/) from Alexandra Stafford.

I mixed the dry ingredients, added some water, and put it in the fridge for a cold proof for two days (48 hours).

Then, I took it out, put a ton of grated parmesan on top, and put it in my proofing box for two hours, this is what it looked like after!

I was super excited since the dough was super happy, it was practically spilling out of my baking pan!

I then dimpled it and added some olive oil.

I then tossed it in the oven for 30 minutes.

Beautiful! It came out super nice and delicious. Super easy recipe, just make sure you have the patience to let it proof in the fridge for two days!

There weren't any challenges I had to overcome here, super easy recipe.

Here's the plot from the proofing box of the temperature and humidity. I had the box set to heat below 80.75F and cool above 81.25F. It was a super hot day anyways so the box might not have been necessary except to keep the humidity up (once again, I put a bowl of water in the box).
