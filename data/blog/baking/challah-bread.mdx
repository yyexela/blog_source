# Baking Challah

Proofer in hand, it was time to bake some bread!

I used [this recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-challah-recipe) from King Arthur. I halved the recipe and instead of 1 large egg and 1 egg yolk, I used two whole large eggs. I also ended up using 95g of extra flour since the dough was super wet (you'll see in the images below).

First step was putting all the ingredients in a bowl!

Then, I mixed it in a stand mixer.

The dough was super wet so I added the extra flour (95g worth).

I put the dough in a bowl and let it proof for 2 hours.

I then split the dough into four pieces and let it proof again (20ish minutes).

Then, I split it into strands and made a nice circular braid.

Then, I proofed it again for another 75 minutes.

Finally, I put it in the oven for 30 minutes, adding a whole egg wash to the top halfway through!

It was super delicious, I ate it with strawberry jam and butter.

Honestly, the main challenge I had from this recipe was that I thought I overdid the flower since I used significantly more than what the recipe called for. However, it turned out fine!

Here's the plot from the proofing box of the temperature and humidity! I had the box set to heat below 80F and cool above 82F. I also had a bowl of water in the box to keep the humidity at 100%.
