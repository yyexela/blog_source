This weekend's baking project was a fruit tart! I loved having these growing up and would request full sized fruit-tarts as my birthday cake. I was feeling nostalgic and didn't want to buy a fruit tart from the local Safeway, and figured making my own would be fulfilling (in more ways than one lol).

I followed [Claire Saffitz'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVh_EXHZsSQ) recipe.
