This weekend's baking project was a fruit tart! I loved having these growing up and would request full sized fruit-tarts as my birthday cake. I was feeling nostalgic and didn't want to buy a fruit tart from the local Safeway, and figured making my own would be fulfilling (in more ways than one lol).

I followed [Claire Saffitz'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVh_EXHZsSQ) recipe.

*Addendum: May 5, 2024*

A fan of the blog asked: "how did it go!! How where the tarts! What did you learn!", so I'm adding that information here!

The first mistake was that the tart shells were sticking to the tin foil a bit when first baking them. The idea is that the tin foil helps keep the shape of the tart shell around the edges, similar to the technique of blind baking where you use parchment paper and fill the shell with beans. I think next time it would be good to oil the tin foil a bit before placing it on the shells.

Another observation was that when whisking together the milk into the egg mixture, the corn starch wasn't really setting until a considerable amount of time. After which, the corn starch thickened *VERY QUICKLY*! It caught me off guard a bit but since I was paying attention I didn't make any mistakes here.

Of course, the fruit tarts were delicious:)
