# Making a Proofing Box

The goal of this project was to create a proofing box to help with baking. The requirement is that I can set the temperature of a box to hold about 80 degrees Farenheight in temperature when the surrounding temperature is much lower. This would help with baking breads and what not in Seattle during the winter! It also helps make baking easier in general, as maintaining a constant proofing temperature reduces baking variability.

One option was to just buy a [Brod and Taylor proofing box](https://brodandtaylor.com/products/folding-proofer-slow-cooker), but they're expensive ($219). So, having a spare Raspberry Pi lying around, I decided to make my own box from scratch!

Okay, so adding everything up, if you decide to buy this all from scratch it'll cost you about the same as a Brod and Taylor proofer. Is it cheaper? Yes, but marginally. The best part, however, is that if you make it yourself it's programmable, has WiFi, Bluetooth, and runs Python. Also, the parts are a lot more replacable and reusable! I didn't include the cost for the small jumper cables or other tiny parts that I had lying around.

(Also, I bought the cooler off Craigslist, I think it costs a lot more new.)

## Assembly

So for assembly it's pretty straight-forward. First, solder the LCD backpack to the LCD screen. Set up your Raspberry Pi as you normally would, add the Stemma QT SHIM on top, and wire it to the LCD backpack and then to the SHT41 sensor. Then, wire the Pi's GPIO pin 28 to the input of the Iot relay and wire a ground pin from the Pi to the ground slot of the Iot relay. Then, power on the Pi from the "always on" port of the relay and connect the germination mat to the "normally off" port of the relay. The code for the Pi is listed at the bottom of this page.

Here's what it looks like assembled!

## Figures

So, I ran the code below, having the Pi power on the heater when the temp dropped below 80F and turn off when it hit above 82F. The first plot shows that it looked like from an initial temperature of under 70F, reaching above 82F. Notice there's a drop in temperature and humidity when I opened it around 11:30am.

The second plot I'll show below shows what happens when I add a bowl of water to the inside of the box.

All this looks great for making bread! The temperature increases, the code works, and the humidity remains high. Next step is to make some bread!
