So this past Saturday I met up with a friend of mine to eat at Midnite Ramen! I heard about it through [Eater Seattle](https://seattle.eater.com/2023/12/5/23989551/midnite-ramen-food-truck-pemanent-location-figurehead-brewing-wallingford), claiming it's one of the best food trucks in Seattle! I sent my friend a list of my top 5 places I've been eyeing and we decided to try Midnite Ramen since we were both craving some good Ramen. It's currently in a cute food truck but is moving to a permanent brick-and-mortar location in less than a month.

I ended up ordering the Kobe Beef Briskey Shoyu, and my friend ordered the Wontonmen (both with extra noodles, of course!)

The food was delicious. We, ended up having a good chat about various topics: love, life goals, and the terrors of front-end development. I'd highly recommend eating here! :)
